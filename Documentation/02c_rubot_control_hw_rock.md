# **2. rUBot mecanum Control**

The main objectives are to control the rUBot movements:
- Navigation
- Self navigation
- Follow wall
- Go to specific pose

### **Setup your workspace**
The rock5b onboard contains the "rUBot_mecanum_ws" repository located in /home/rock folder 

We will create a "rubot_control" package to perform the rUBot_mecanum control movements:
```shell
cd ~/rUBot_mecanum_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg rubot_control rospy std_msgs sensor_msgs geometry_msgs nav_msgs
cd ..
catkin_make
```
>- review the ~/.bashrc: source to the ws

First of all you need to bringup the rubot_mecanum robot.

## **2.1. Bringup rubot_mecanum**

The bringup consists to:
- launch the rUBot node in Arduino-Mega board
- launch the LIDAR node
- launch the usb_cam node

You will launch first "rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch" file to setup the rUBot_mecanum.

```shell
roslaunch rubot_mecanum_description rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch
```
## **2.2. Movement control rubot_mecanum**

We will control the rUBot_mecanum using:
- The keyboard
- With a custom node created in a speciffic python program 

### **Movement control using keyboard**

To control the gopigo robot with keyboard, we need to install "teleop_tools" package. Open a new terminal and install the packages:
```shell
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-teleop-tools
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-teleop-twist-keyboard
```
Proceed with:
- Bringup rUBot_mecanum
```shell
roslaunch rubot_mecanum_description rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch
```
- Then open a new terminal and type:
```shell
rosrun key_teleop key_teleop.py /key_vel:=/cmd_vel
or
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```
You are now able to move your robot using keyboard

### **Movement control with custom node**

From the "rUBot_mecanum_ws" workspace, the src/rubot_control folder has 2 new folders:
- scrip folder: with the python programs for specific movement control
- launch folder: with programs to launch the movement control

Different navigation programs are created:

- Navigation control: to define a desired robot velocity twist vector
- Lidar test: to verify the LIDAR readings and angles
- Autonomous navigation: to perform a simple algorithm for navigation with obstacle avoidance using the LIDAR
- Wall follower: at a fixed distance to perform a good map
- go to POSE: attend a specific position and orientation

The nodes and topics structure corresponds to the following picture:
![Getting Started](./Images/02_rubot_rock/01b_nodes_topics.png)

### **a) Navigation control**

We have created a first navigation python files in "src" folder:

- **rubot_nav.py**: to define the movement with vx, vy and w for a time period

A "node_nav.launch" file is created to launch the node and python file created above.

To properly perform a especific movement control we have first to:
- Bringup rUBot_mecanum
```shell
roslaunch rubot_mecanum_description rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch
```
- Then open a new terminal to launch the rUBot_nav node to perform the specific movement control.
```shell
roslaunch rubot_control rubot_nav.launch
```

### **b) LIDAR test**

In order to navigate autonomously and avoid obstacles, we will use a specific rpLIDAR sensor. To verify the LIDAR readings and angles we have generated the "rubot_lidar_test.py" python file:

To properly perform a especific movement control we have first to:
- Bringup rUBot_mecanum
```shell
roslaunch rubot_mecanum_description rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch
```
- Then open a new terminal to launch the rUBot_nav node to perform the rpLIDAR test. We have created specific python file and launch file for this test control
```shell
roslaunch rubot_control rubot_lidar_test.launch
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```
**Activity**

Modify this "rubot_lidar_test.py" file to measure the number of laser beams and convert the beam index in Degrees yaw angle.

### **c) Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance**

Using rpLIDAR sensor you can perform the autonomous navigation avoiding obstacles.

This performance is defined in "rubot_self_nav.py"

To properly perform a especific self-navigation control we have first to:
- Bringup rUBot_mecanum
```shell
roslaunch rubot_mecanum_description rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch
```
- Then open a new terminal to launch the rUBot_nav node to perform the self-navigation. We have created specific python file and launch file for this navigation control
```shell
roslaunch rubot_control rubot_self_nav.launch
```

A launch file is created to integrate all the needed roslaunch parameters but you can change the defauld values with this syntax:
```shell
roslaunch rubot_control rubot_self_nav.launch distance_laser:=0.5 speed_factor:=0.5
```
### **D) Wall Follower**

This control task consist on find a wall and follow it at a certain distance. We will see that this is an important control task because this will be used later to make accurate maps of working environments.

#### **Geometrical method**
In src folder you create the python file for wall follower purposes

To properly perform a especific self-navigation control we have first to:
- Bringup rUBot_mecanum
```shell
roslaunch rubot_mecanum_description rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch
```
- Then open a new terminal to launch the rUBot_nav node to perform the wall-follower. We have created specific python file and launch file for this navigation control
```shell
roslaunch rubot_control rubot_wall_follower_gm.launch
```
Modify the paramenters to obtain proper wall follower navigation performances.

### **E) Go to POSE**

The objective is to program the robot to reach a speciffic target POSE defining:
- x position
- y position
- angle orientation (from 0ยบ to 180ยบ)

To properly perform a especific self-navigation control we have first to:
- Bringup rUBot_mecanum
```shell
roslaunch rubot_mecanum_description rubot_bringup_hw_rock.launch
```
- Then open a new terminal to launch the rUBot_nav node to perform the go 2 pose control. We have created specific python file and launch file for this navigation control
```shell
roslaunch rubot_control rubot_go2pose.launch
```
